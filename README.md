Ghana Election Sentiment Analysis Project - Complete Summary
üéØ Project Overview
A comprehensive sentiment analysis system that analyzes Ghanaian Twitter discourse about the 2024 presidential candidates John Mahama and Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

üèõÔ∏è Academic Context
Institution: University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR)

Department: Information Technology and Decision Sciences (ITDS)

Project Type: Final Year Research Project

Timeline: January 2024 - November 2024 (pre-election period)

üéØ Core Objectives
Main Objective
To develop and evaluate an automated sentiment analysis system using NLP and machine learning to classify Ghanaian sentiments on Twitter about the presidential candidates.

Specific Objectives
Data Collection: Gather tweets using Twitter API focused on both candidates

Text Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text data using NLP techniques

Model Implementation: Train and compare multiple ML models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, TextBlob)

Performance Evaluation: Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Visualization: Create interactive dashboards showing sentiment trends

Deployment: Build end-to-end pipeline for future political analysis
